    The competitions and results are two different arrays that contain the
    competition details.

    about .enumerate():
    when dealing with iterators, we also get a need to keep a count of
    iterations. Python eases the programmersâ€™ task by providing a built-in
    function enumerate() for this task. Enumerate() method adds a counter to
    an iterable and returns it in a form of enumerating object. This
    enumerated object can then be used directly for loops or converted into a
    list of tuples using the list() method.
